struct Modem {
uint8_t pwkey;
bool ready;
bool did_config;
bool sim_ready;
uint8_t radio;
uint16_t cops;
bool force;
char tech_string[16];
uint8_t technology;
};

from BG95 lib:
Modem op = {
/_ pwkey _/ 0,
/_ ready _/ false,
/_ did_config _/ false,
/_ sim_ready _/ false,
/_ radio _/ 0,
/_ cops _/ 0,
